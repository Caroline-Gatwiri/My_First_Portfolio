                 <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring software developer with a passion for building applications that solve real-world problems. My journey into technology started with curiosity about how websites and mobile apps are created, and over time, that curiosity has grown into a clear career path. I enjoy learning new skills, exploring different areas of technology, and finding creative ways to turn ideas into working solutions.</p>
        <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>I am currently enrolled in the ALX program, where I am strengthening my professional foundations while working on exciting projects. Alongside this, I am learning Android development with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, as well as exploring front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Balancing these courses has taught me the value of discipline, consistency, and continuous improvement as I work toward becoming a well-rounded developer.</p>
        <h3>Skills in Progress</h3>
        <p>At the moment, I am building my foundation in several key technologies. In web development, I am practicing HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. I am also learning React, which allows me to create more dynamic and responsive user interfaces. On the mobile side, I am developing my skills in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose to design Android apps. Each step I take brings me closer to mastering these tools and contributing meaningfully to the tech world.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to become a versatile developer who can build both mobile and web applications that have a positive impact. I am especially interested in working remotely, collaborating with diverse teams, and using technology to address challenges in areas like education, healthcare, and governance. This portfolio represents the first step in sharing my journey and the skills I continue to grow.</p>
